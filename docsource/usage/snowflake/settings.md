# Settings

In order to use SQL Mock with Snowflake, you need to provide the following environment variables when you run tests:

* `SQL_MOCK_SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT`: The name of your Snowflake account
* `SQL_MOCK_SNOWFLAKE_USER`: The name of your Snowflake user
* `SQL_MOCK_SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD`: The password for your Snowflake user

Having those environment variables enables SQL Mock to connect to your Snowflake instance.
