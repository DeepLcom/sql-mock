# Settings

In order to use SQL Mock with Redshift, you need to provide the following environment variables when you run tests:

* `SQL_MOCK_REDSHIFT_HOST`: The host of your Redshift instance
* `SQL_MOCK_REDSHIFT_USER`: The user of your Redshift instance
* `SQL_MOCK_REDSHIFT_PASSWORD`: The password of your Redshift instance
* `SQL_MOCK_REDSHIFT_PORT`: The port of your Redshift instance

Having those environment variables enables SQL Mock to connect to your Redshift instance.
